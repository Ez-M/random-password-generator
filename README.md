# random-password-generator

## Desciption
Generates a random password according to user requirements. 
This project provided an opprotunity to become familiar with putting together a practical solution in Javascript.
It began with simply asking a question, and then in plain text outlining an answer to that question.
The solution overall is very simple, but it provided a lot of hands-on learning in how to apply functions, random number generation, concatenating arrays, passing outputs from one function to another, and outputing text from Java onto the users interface.
